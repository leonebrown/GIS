To convert ERDAS .img files to .tif to read in Jupyter notebook

First, need to be able to access gdal:
1) install gdal in a new environment. In the terminal, type:
'conda create -n TEST_GDAL python=3.7'
OR?? (I think I used the code below)
'conda create --yes -n TEST_GDAL python=3.7 gdal'
2) Activate by typing: 'conda activate TEST_GDAL'
3) Install gdal: conda install gdal -c conda-forge
(I'm not sure if this step is necessary if it was already installed before the new environment was set, but can check
if installed by typing 'gdalinfo --version'
4) To eactivate environment: 'deactivate'
5) To reactivate environment: 'activate TEST_GDAL'

To convert .img to .tif:
1) Activate gdal environment: 'conda activate TEST_GDAL'
2) Check working directory: 'pwd'
3) Change working directory to path containing .img files, e.g., 'cd ~/Dropbox/DataScienceStuff/Data/RasterShapefiles/NLCD'
4) Call .img files to convert to .tif: 'gdal_translate -of GTiff NLCD_2008_Land_Cover_L48_20190424.img NLCD_2008.tif'

To access gdal within Jupyter Notebook
1) 'conda activate TEST_GDAL'
2) Install jupyter: 'pip install jupyterlab'
3) Also must (re-)install any other packages you wish to use within Jupyter Notebook within this environment (pip or conda installs)
4) 'jupyter notebook'
